### Minor Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/monots/monots/pull/22) [`bee017f`](https://github.com/monots/monots/commit/bee017f0106ecf9704b5b09b2bce2c1d69c31387) Thanks [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr)! - Publish `monots` as a placeholder package so that the name doesn't get taken. It doesn't currently do anything but it will do in the future.
